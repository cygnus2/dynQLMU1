%  Description of development of the ED code    %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. CODES1: This incorporates
           a) bit-wise representation of the basis states.
           b) Fast gauge-invariant state counting, which can avoid a single jam point. 
              This works easily for 6x6, but becomes slow for 8x6.
           c) Filters basis states which have no flippable plaquettes. 
           d) The whole Hamiltonian matrix (for abritrary lambda) is constructed without regard to 
              symmetry.
           e) In terms of diagonalization, it can work fast till ~32 spins using the Intel FEAST 
              routine.
           f) Computes a local observable, ie, the flippability of individual plaquettes, summed
              over the volume for all the eigenvectors.

2. CODES2: In addition to the actions in CODES1, this version
           a) Does not explicitly filter any states.
           b) Does a winding number decomposition.
           c) Constructs the Hamiltonian in the specified winding number sector. 
           d) Calculates the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, still using Intel FEAST. 
           e) Same as (f).
